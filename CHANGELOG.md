# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.7] - 2019-10-20

- Implement library "Artists" view - [#67](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/pull/67) thanks [@svenvNL](https://github.com/svenvNL). NOTE that this adds an additional scope (`user-follow-read`), so you'll be prompted to grant this new permissions when you upgrade.
- Fix searching with non-english characters - [#30](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/pull/30). Thanks to [@fangyi-zhou](https://github.com/fangyi-zhou)
- Remove hardcoded country (was always set to UK). We now fetch the user to get their country. [#68](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/pull/68). Thanks to [@svenvNL](https://github.com/svenvNL)
- Save currently playing track - the playbar is now selectable/hoverable [#80](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/pull/80)
- Lay foundation for showing if a track is saved. You can now see if the currently playing track is saved (indicated by â™¥)

## [0.0.6] - 2019-10-14

### Added

- Start a web server on localhost to display a simple webpage for the Redirect URI. Should hopefully improve the onboarding experience.
- Add ability to skip to tracks using `n` for next and `p` for previous - thanks to [@samcal](https://github.com/samcal)

- The event `A` will jump to the album list of the first artist in the track's artists list - closing [#45](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/issues/45)
- Add volume controls - use `-` to decrease and `+` to increase volume in 10% increments. Closes [#57](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/issues/57)

### Fixed

- Keep format of highlighted track when it is playing - [#44](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/pull/44) thanks to [@jfaltis](https://github.com/jfaltis)
- Search input bug: Fix "out-of-bounds" crash when pressing left too many times [#63](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/issues/63)
